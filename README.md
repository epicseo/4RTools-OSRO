# OSRO Tools

## Overview
OSRO Tools is a fork of [TalesTools](https://github.com/biancaazuma/TalesTools), which was originally based on [4RTools](https://github.com/4RTools/4RTools). This project refines and adapts the tool for enhanced compatibility with [OsRO MR](https://osro.mr/) and [OsRO HR](https://osro.gg/).

## Key Changes
- **Language & Adaptation:** Re-translated back into English and adjusted to align with OsRO's status set.
- **Weight-Based Auto-Disable:** Added a setting to disable 4RTools when overweight (at 50% or 90%) and trigger an Alt-# macro.
- **Expanded Skill Support:** Included Padawan (Jedi/Sith) skills along with corresponding skill icons.
- **Pre-Renewal Focus:** Removed most Renewal skills to maintain compatibility.
- **Macro Toggle Simplification:** Reverted from two toggle buttons (one for heal, another for all other macros) back to a single toggle.
- **UI & Theming:** Reverted from a dark theme to a light theme to better match the RO client.
- **Miscellaneous Improvements:**
  - Various UI tweaks.
  - Updated NuGet packages.
  - Upgraded .NET framework from v4.7.2 to v4.8.1.

### Installation Steps
1. Download the `.zip` file from the [release page](https://github.com/torrq/4RTools-OSRO/releases).
2. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice.
3. Run `OSRO Tools.exe` as Administrator.
4. Configure your settings according to your needs.
5. Ensure your game client is running before enabling macros.

> **Note:** Some antivirus programs may flag the executable as a false positive. If this happens, add an exception for the folder where you extracted the files.
